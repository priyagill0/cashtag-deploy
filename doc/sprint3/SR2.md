**Unfinished Tasks**

No unfinished tasks for this sprint. 

**Practices to Continue**

- Regular team stand-ups to track progress and blockers as well as keep the entire team up to date.
- Deleating tasks equally based on story points to ensure that each person can contribute an equal workload and all tasks are completed by the end of the sprint.
- Update the board every time there is an update to the status of a feature.
- Use Git branches and pull requests to keep organized.


**New Practices to Try**

- Thoroughly document code for clarity so team members can easily build off of the existing code.
- Ensure that the user story is fully understood before starting the feature implementation.

**Practices to Stop or Improve**

- Leave more time at the end of the sprint for thorough testing.
- Share blockers early on so everyone is on the same page.

**Best/Worst Experience**
- Best: Seeing major features (like Groups, Budgets, Dashboard) come together smoothly. Everyone being able to finish their tasks, even though it felt challenging at first.
- Worst: Having to coordinate with everyone regarding which files we are working on to prevent conflicts.
