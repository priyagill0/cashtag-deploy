October 24, 2025 - Sprint 1 Standup 2

1. What did you work on since the last standup?
   
   We all have been starting to work on our respective tasks, and some of us had trouble setting up the local project environemnt so we worked towards resolving this. We completed the [category strcuture](https://eecs-3311-team-x.atlassian.net/browse/E3TXS-40) and [_expense structure_](https://eecs-3311-team-x.atlassian.net/browse/E3TXS-41) tickets which we had to finish earlier so that other members can begin building off of these these backend structures to complete their tasks.

2. What do you commit to next?
   
   Next, we want to get started on the login/signup form, and the forntend form that users fill out to add an expense.

3. When do you think you'll be done?
   
   We think we will complete the login and sign up tickets early next week and the other tasks we expect to take some more time, and will continue to work on.

4. Do you have any blockers?
   
   None as of now.
