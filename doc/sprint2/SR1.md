**Unfinished Tasks**

**Story**: Add Recurring Monthly Expenses (E3TXS-36)

**Description:** As a user, I want to set up recurring monthly expenses (like rent or subscriptions) so I don’t have to manually add them every month.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
The user can mark any expense as recurring monthly.


The recurring expenses automatically appear in future months.

**Reason for Incompletion:** Backend setup and recurring checkbox logic were started but not finalized during Sprint 1. Both subtasks (E3TXS-43 and E3TXS-44) remain To Do and have been moved to the Sprint 2 backlog.


**Practices to Continue**

- Regular team stand-ups to track progress and blockers.
- Continue clear division of work using Git branches and pull requests.


**New Practices to Try**

- Add small checkpoints mid-sprint to avoid last-minute rush before the demo.
- Document code more thoroughly for frontend–backend clarity.


**Practices to Stop or Improve**
- Avoid working on large features without intermediate commits.
- Make sure to not merge directly into the main branch; merge only to develop.
- Don't pushing without confirming the correct branch — this caused confusion and extra reverts.


**Best/Worst Experience**
- Best: Successfully integrating the frontend with the backend for adding and viewing expenses, it was rewarding to see it working end-to-end.
- Worst: We struggled with Git, especially pushing code to the wrong branch and dealing with reverts. This slowed down progress some features and caused extra stress before the demo.
