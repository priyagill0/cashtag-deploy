# Summary

Cashtag is a full-stack application that helps students and young adults manage both personal and shared finances. Unlike traditional budgeting apps, this tool introduces fairness algorithms, budgeting insights, and gamification, making expense management both practical and engaging.

This application will:

- Simplify financial tracking for both individuals and groups.
Promote financial responsibility through goal-setting and progress insights.
- Enable fair expense sharing among friends, roommates, and groups.
- Encourage consistent engagement with the tool using gamification elements such as badges and friendly challenges.
- Provide actionable insights using a clear visual dashboard, budget summaries, and progress of the user’s goals.

### Key Users
- **Students/Young Adults:** 

    Individuals learning to manage personal finances effectively. For example, tracking daily spending and saving toward goals like rent or travel.
- **Roommates/Friends:** 

    Groups who share common expenses. For example, splitting rent, groceries, or utilities fairly.

- **Clubs/Small Organizations:**
    
    Teams managing pooled funds for events or trips. For example, tracking membership fees, event costs, and reimbursements.

### Key Use Cases

- **Personal Budgeting:**

    - Users can set the monthly limit they would like to achieve for each category and track their progress throughout the month. 
    
    - To help the users be more aware of their spendings, they will receive alerts when they are nearing their budget. This will encourage the user to stick to their budget and even reward them by earning badges for meeting goals (ex. “You saved $200 this month!”).

- **Group Expense Tracking:**

    - User creates or joins a group (ex. “Waterloo Roomates”).

    - Members log shared expenses and the app automatically calculates who owes money based on who paid for certain expenses towards the group.

- **Optimizing Transactions for Splitting Group Payments:**

    - The app minimizes transactions using a net settlement algorithm. Instead of showing raw debts (“A owes B $50, B owes C $30”), optimize transactions: Net settle up (A → C $20, fewer transactions).

    - This makes splitting group payments a lot easier, reducing the hassle that comes with making group transactions.

- **Insights Dashboard:**

    - Provides a financial summary for the user such as their total spending, category trends, goal completion, and outstanding money they owe to other users.

    - Highlights categories that are approaching the budget limit. 

- **Gamification:**

    - Users earn badges for maintaining streaks, reaching goals, or using the app consistently.

    - Users can compete with each other through leaderboards within friend groups (ex. who earned more badges or who reached their goal first), creating friendly competition.

    - Motivational messages (ex. “You are on the way to saving enough for your dream trip”)

    - Group challenges (ex. “As a group, let’s save $100 this month on food.”)

By merging personal budgeting and group expense management into one application, this will allow users to gain better control over their finances, maintain fairness when splitting costs between multiple people, and build practical budgeting habits all while having fun through the gamified experience.
