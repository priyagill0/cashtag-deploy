# Competition

### Splitwise: https://www.splitwise.com 
- Our product differs in the sense that it is more personalized, with the individual user's budget being the main focus.
- Cashtag includes goal tracking, budgeting insights, and gamification. 
- On the other hand, these features are not available on Splitwise, as its primary focus is on group spending and settling debts among people.
- Cashtag is better suited for users who would like to set financial goals for themselves and maintain them. An example of a user includes students tracking their monthly personal spending along with sharing rent and grocery costs. Additionally, it is for anyone who would like to view their spending patterns and identify areas where they can save. 
- Our application makes budgeting engaging through gamification. Users can track streaks, gain badges, and compete in small challenges which makes finances motivating. This is an emotional attribute that Splitwise does not offer.
- Since Splitwise targets a broad audience, it would not need to include features such as personal budgeting. 
- In order to incorporate these attributes, it would have to update their user interface for insights dashboards as well as goal tracking. Regarding the gaming functions, Splitwise would have to decide on a system of level and what counts as a point/badge. For instance, reaching savings goals, paying off debts, and more.

### YNBA: https://www.ynab.com
- Cashtag is able to blend both personal budgeting as well as group expense tracking. The application manages both expenses. On the contrary, YNBA focuses solely on individual budgeting.
- Moreover, Cashtag includes alerts for over-spending and dividing group expenses.
- YNBA is educational, but it is not fun or game-like. Managing money can feel daunting to many young adults, and some would rather avoid it altogether. Including a game-like approach with badges, points, etc. can feel more lighthearted and encourage young audiences to be proactive with their finances.
- The competitor company targets people seeking to manage their personal finances. Including group components can shift their focus and appeal to a different user base which risks losing their own they have already developed. Implementing these features would require development resources and could complicate the user experience.
- To add group elements, YNBA would have to create multi-user accounts linked to the same groups. Furthermore, updates when a person logs a shared expense is needed. Similarly, any edits or deletions need to be seen by the entire group.
- To incorporate gaming attributes, the marketing of the company would have to take a different approach. YNAB’s brand seems to be strictly educational and including gamification could make themselves seem playful. They would have to decide whether this is the message they want to convey.
