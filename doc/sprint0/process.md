# Process: How We Worked Together

Our team worked as a group of five members, Ashal, Priya, Abrar, Eesha, and Melanie where each took on different roles based on our strengths. Priya and Eesha led the organization and backend planning, Melanie and Abrar handled user stories and documentation, and Ashal focused on UI/UX design ideas. 

We used Trello to keep track of our tasks and user stories. Each card represented one feature or story, such as “Create Group,” “Add Expense,” or “View Dashboard.” We used Trello labels to separate features into Personal and Group sections and moved cards through “To-Do,” and “Done.”

For communication, we used the Discord group chat for quick updates and Google Docs for shared writing and feedback. This kept everyone informed even when we couldn’t meet in person.

We also made decisions together on our weekly meetings during the lab sessions. When we needed to choose between ideas (for example, how to design the charts on the dashboard or handle group debts), each member shared their opinion, and we discussed the pros and cons.
	
If we couldn’t agree right away, we used a simple majority vote. Usually, it only took one or two rounds of voting to make a final decision. To set priorities, we looked at which features were most important for the user and which ones connected to other parts of the app. We ranked the user stories from “important” (like login and adding expenses) to “extra” (like gamification badges or insights).

We met once a week after class and also worked asynchronously through Trello updates, Discord and shared documents. During meetings, we reviewed what was done, what needed work, and any other tasks. Each day ended with a short check-in conversation to confirm progress and assign next steps for the upcoming days.

Working together taught us the value of clear communication and regular updates. Using Trello and shared folders helped us stay organized and prevented overlapping work. We also learned that defining clear priorities early on saves time later, especially when deciding which features to build first. For the next phase, we plan to continue short, weekly check-ins and test features earlier to avoid last-minute fixes.

Overall, the teamwork process went smoothly, and each member contributed consistently. The project grew stronger because we combined different skills, shared ideas openly, and worked together toward a common goal.
